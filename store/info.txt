#short description
Full-pinning the screen of your smart phone

#description
"When you pass a smartphone to others, other parts can be seen and other concerns".
SecureScreen eliminates such anxiety.
With this application, you can block touching content on screen and moving to other apps.

□ Usage
· I want to show travel photos but when I do not want to show other photos in the image folder.
· It is necessary to show a specific mail, but it is troublesome to see other mails.

To further increase the effect
Turn on the screen fixation from [Settings] application -> [security] -> [Screen pinning] and turn ON the [Require password (depending on the locking method used) before releasing the screen fix I will recommend it.
You can still use the application even if [Fixed screen] is OFF, but further safety can be expected by the above setting.
